## Course Description
This course...

## Prerequisites
Although there are no class prerequisistes, a strong foundation in programming will make this class much easier. Please contact me if you have concerns. 

## Readings
There are no required textbooks. Reading will be provided via journal articles, online materials, and tutorials

## Grades and wfaorkload
The course grade is based on three items:
* Homework: 40%
* Participation: 20%
* Final Project: 40%

### Homework
There will be 8 homework assignments; these...

### Participation
* Students should bring a laptop to class to follow along the lecture on their own jupyter lab Docker container that they are using for the course. 
* Most Tuesdays we will begin with a 15-30 minute review of the previous week's assignment. Groups of 1-2 students will present and discuss the solutions to the assignment. 
* We will be using Piazza for most communication outside of class. This will facilitate interaction among the class members which will make it easier to work through the assignments. 

### Collaboration
Collaboration in completing assignments is permitted. However, each student should write up their assignment independently. We will be checking for nearly identical homeworks. 

### Final Project
The final project includes three components:
* Proposal (March 19th via email)
  * 2 pages, Single-spaced, 12 point font size, 1 inch margin
  * Contains: Title, Introduction and Objectives, Methodology, and a timeline of tasks
* Oral presentation (April 23rd-25th in class)*
  * AGU style, 12 minute oral presentation, 3 minutes for questions
  * Everyone needs to be present for each presentation
  
### Schedule
Note that the schedule is subject to change; changes will be announced in class and the online syllabus will be updated.
