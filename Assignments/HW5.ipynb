    "In homework 2, we found using the spherical law of cosines, that the arc length between Durham and Chicago is 998.233 km. If we first project the geographical coordinates of the two cities onto a 2d plane, we should, in principle, be able to use the euclidean distance to calculate the distance between the two cities. Using this approach, calculate the distance between Durham and Chicago using the following three map projections. Provide a one paragraph explanation of how the computed distances differ.\n",

Start by assembling an array of actual area per pixel and then compute for each year the area weighted mean. Then compare the resulting time series to that resulting from using the equally weighted spatial mean (i.e., naive approach). Provide an explanation of your results."
