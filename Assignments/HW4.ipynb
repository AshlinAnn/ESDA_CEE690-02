    "The file `/data/IMERG/GPM_3IMERGDF_06/IMERG_07_2000-2018_rc.nc` provides daily estimates from IMERG of precipitation for each day of every July between 2000 and 2018. Extract the time series of data for Nairobi (Kenya), Beirut (Lebanon),  Shanghai (China), Sydney (Australia), Miami (United States), Bogota (Colombia), Johannesburg (South Africa), Toronto (Canada), and Buenos Aires (Argentina). After removing all days where the precipitation is 0, fit an exponential distribution for the data at each site. Using subplots, make a 3x3 figure where each subplot contains the histogram of each site's data (also zero precipitation removed) and the corresponding PDF of the fitted exponential distribution. To finalize, write a paragraph explaining how these plots can be interpreted with an emphasis on understanding the differences in intensity of daily rainfall between these cities in July.\n",

The evaluation should only be performed at latitudes above -50 degrees and below 50 degrees. Within this domain, at each pixel, compute the linear correlation (scipy.stats.pearsonr) between the time series of precipitation of IMERG and ERA-Interim. Make a plot using imshow of the resulting 2D array of correlation coefficients over the domain (lat:-50 to 50,lon:0 to 360).
